# What is this?
A public repository that lists some of the most annoying/suspicious/dangerous users that I found on various platforms. It is meant to be used as a blacklist in places I moderate (such as my online games and Discord servers).

# How to appeal?
Create an issue with the following information:
- The **platform**
- Your relevant **userID** on that platform
- A paragraph about **why** you should be removed from the list

# Contribution
**You don't.** All 3rd-party pull requests and issues related to addition of new entries will be ignored or closed. However, you can fork this repo and modify that at your will.
This is done to prevent malicious people from adding people that they don't like.

# Important notes
- **DO NOT RELY ON THESE LISTS!** You shouldn't fully trust these lists as they might contain false positives and bias. Also the way that the entries are stored might change in the future. So **absolutely no warranties**!
- Only the minimum required information is recorded (that is the userIDs and possibly the simplified reasons). None of the info here can/should be used to track someone.
